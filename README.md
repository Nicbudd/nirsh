# NIRSH - nicbudd's interactive rust shell (and coreutils)

This is a project I like to work on in my free time. I implement features as I wish and I have no intention of making this "complete" by any stretch of the imagination. It's a low stress side project for me.

It consists of a shell that can run executables from path directories, and a set of common utilities, inspired by the GNU coreutils.
